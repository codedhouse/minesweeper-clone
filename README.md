# Minesweeper Clone
A clone-in-progress of the classic Minesweeper, one of my favorite games from yore.

### Current features:
* 9x9 puzzle grid.
* Timer that tells the user how long it took to win a puzzle.
* After a game ends (win or lose), a new board is automatically generated.

### Planned improvements:
* Save fastest times.
* Add larger grid sizes.
* Improve speed of clearing several tiles at once.
* Replace Swing with JavaFX.
